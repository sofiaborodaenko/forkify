## 🧠 What I Did

This project focused heavily on mastering modern front-end development. My contributions included:

- Architecting the application using the **MVC pattern**
- Implementing all JavaScript logic from scratch
- Handling asynchronous API calls using `async/await`
- Managing state, rendering UI updates, and form validation
- Building modular and reusable view components
- Using Parcel for asset bundling and efficient development

## 📘 Credits

- Design inspiration and base HTML/CSS structure from the "Forkify" course project by Jonas Schmedtmann
